# Use-popcorn
Developed and designed an exciting ReactJS application for movie ratings. Uses an external API that exposes the latest movies and using that we can see IMDB ratings of movies as well as we can give personal user ratings. Designed in a way that on page load search box gets focused automatically and it will give you total search results and numbers for the searched keyword. On clicking on the movie from the list it shows the movieâ€™s details along with the thumbnail image of the movie where we can give a user rating. We also can edit ratings by removing them from the list and adding them again with new ratings. Please visit the below link for more details.
